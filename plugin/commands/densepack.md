description: Turn DensePack on and put all settings back to default.

Run the Bash line with the Bash tool. When Claude Code has no Bash tool, run the PowerShell line with the PowerShell tool instead. Run it:

Bash: sh "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run_hook.sh" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/dpctl.py" on

PowerShell: powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run_hook.ps1" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/dpctl.py" on

Then relay the status line to the user in one sentence.

It removes the off switch and the quiet switch. It sets all options back to their default values.
