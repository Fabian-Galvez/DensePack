Run the Bash line with the Bash tool. When Claude Code has no Bash tool, run the PowerShell line with the PowerShell tool instead.

Bash: sh "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run_hook.sh" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/dpctl.py" help

PowerShell: powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run_hook.ps1" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/dpctl.py" help

Then print the output exactly as the command returns it. Do not summarize it and do not reorder it.

The output shows no current setting.
