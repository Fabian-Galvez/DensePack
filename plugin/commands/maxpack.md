description: Send Sonnet images. This is the default. Haiku still gets text.

Run the Bash line with the Bash tool. When Claude Code has no Bash tool, run the PowerShell line with the PowerShell tool instead. Run it:

Bash: sh "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run_hook.sh" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/dpctl.py" maxpack

PowerShell: powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run_hook.ps1" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/dpctl.py" maxpack

Then relay the status line to the user in one sentence.

/max-off sends Sonnet text again.
